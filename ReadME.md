# FrozenFox
___
This is just a mix of hacks, tweaks and customizations I personally enjoy and use as my day-to-day setup. I am  currently running Manjaro KDE Plasma while using this modified version of firefox, but I cannot attest to the functionality for any Windows or Mac users. I understand this level of minimalism may not be for everybody, which is totally understandable. Nobody ever accused me of having good taste. 

First of all, you will need the following files in your **chrome folder** if you want any of the *uc.js* scripts to work:
- bindings.xml
- userChrome.js
- userChrome.xml
- ooo_xPref.uc.js
- saveUCJS.uc.js

From there, everything else is just a matter of preference. There are plenty of other uc.js scripts out there that are fun to use, but I didn't want to clutter up the repo so I only included the ones I am currently using.

I am in no way a programmer and have no teaching/training whatsoever, so if it extremely hacky I apologize. I picked it up as a hobby and am just having fun with it. If you see anything glaringly wrong or unnecessary, just open up an issue. Same goes for if you see an opportunity for improvement that I may have overlooked.
